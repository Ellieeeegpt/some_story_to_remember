                It doesn't matter anymore.
            </p>

            <p>
                Not because I don't care.<br>
                Not because it wasn't real.<br>
                Not because it didn't hurt.
            </p>

            <p>
                But because I finally understand.
            </p>

            <div class="understanding-list">
                <p>
                    <strong>I understand</strong> that some people come into your life not to stay, 
                    but to teach you something you desperately needed to learn.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>I understand</strong> that you can genuinely care about someone 
                    and still recognize that being with them would break you both.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>I understand</strong> that stopping at the sweetest moment, 
                    even when it feels incomplete, is sometimes the kindest thing you can do for a memory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>I understand</strong> that not all beautiful things are meant to be possessed. 
                    Some are just meant to be witnessed, appreciated, and then released.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>I understand</strong> that my anxious, desperate, fearful younger self 
                    was doing her absolute best with what she knew. She deserves compassion, not judgment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>I understand</strong> that he was doing his best too. 
                    That his limitations weren't rejections. That his silence wasn't cruelty. 
                    That he simply wasn't ready, and maybe never will be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And that's okay.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Not all beautiful stories need happy endings.<br>
                Some just need to be told with honesty."
            </div>

            <p>
                This story shaped me in ways I'm still discovering.
            </p>

            <p>
                It taught me what it feels like to really connect with someone — 
                that rare frequency where you both geek out over the same obscure things, 
                where silence feels comfortable, where being yourself doesn't require translation.
            </p>

            <p>
                It taught me that I'm capable of deep feeling. Of hoping. Of trying even when I'm terrified.
            </p>

            <p>
                It also taught me my limits. Where my anxiety lives. What triggers my fear of abandonment. 
                How I react when I feel like I'm losing something precious.
            </p>

            <p>
                And most importantly: it taught me that I can survive heartbreak.
            </p>

            <p>
                Not just survive — I can walk through it, sit with it, learn from it, 
                and eventually transform it into something that makes me wiser, kinder, stronger.
            </p>

            <div class="code-memory">

            <p>
                I don't regret this story.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yes, it hurt. Yes, I lost sleep and appetite and peace of mind. 
                Yes, there were moments I thought I wouldn't make it through.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I did make it through.
            </p>

            <p>
                And I'm better for it.

                <p>I hope you found that person who can geek out with you about automata 
                and programming and all those nerdy things that make your eyes light up — 
                and who also has the emotional capacity to show up consistently.</p>
                
                <p>I hope you learned to balance your intensity with gentleness. 
                Your passion with patience. Your hope with healthy boundaries.</p>
                
                <p>I hope you remember this story with fondness, not pain. 
                That you can see how young you were, how brave you were, 
                how beautifully human you were in your imperfection.</p>

                confusion into clarity.</p>
