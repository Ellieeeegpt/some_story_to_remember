                It started the way most important things do — quietly, unremarkably, 
                on an ordinary Tuesday afternoon in a study room I'd claimed as my own.
            </p>

            <p>
                I didn't know his name yet. I just knew he appeared about three months ago, 
                suddenly showing up in that small room where I spent my afternoons. 
                He said he didn't even know that room existed before.
            </p>

            <p>
                Twice a week. Like clockwork. First sitting across from me, 
                then sometimes beside me, as if the distance between us was something 
                that could be measured in chair positions.
            </p>

            <div class="memory-box">
                <p><strong>First impression:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    He would shake his head to music — not subtly, but with this almost 
                    aggressive enthusiasm that made it impossible not to notice. 
                    I remember thinking it was a bit much. A bit childish, even.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once, he burst out laughing at the back of the room because the charging 
                    station wasn't plugged in. Just that. Such a small thing to find so funny.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                In the beginning, he never spoke first. He would sit there, do his work, 
                and wait. Wait for me to say something. Anything. And when I did, 
                he would listen — really listen — and then the conversation would unfold 
                naturally, like he'd been waiting for permission to exist in the same space as me.
            </p>

            <p>
                After about a month, he started initiating. Small things at first. 
                Comments about the assignment. Questions about a concept. 
                Always taking off his earphone on the side closer to me.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                I noticed he never used contractions when texting me. 
                Every "I am" was spelled out. Every "do not" kept its dignity. 
                It felt formal in a way that made me feel... considered.
            </div>

            <p>
                I don't know why that mattered. But it did.
            </p>

            <div class="code-memory">
<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="string">firstImpression</span> = {
  <span class="comment">// He was different from the local students</span>
  communication: <span class="string">"formal, careful with words"</span>,
  behavior: <span class="string">"enthusiastic but awkward"</span>,
  boundaries: <span class="string">"respectful, almost too polite"</span>,
  
  <span class="comment">// His emoji evolution</span>
  initialReaction: <span class="string">"👍"</span>,
  <span class="comment">// Later it would change to ❤️</span>
  <span class="comment">// I didn't know what that meant yet</span>
};
            </div>

            <p>
                We talked about classes. Professors he found frustrating. 
                Internships we were both anxious about. The small details of daily life 
                that people share when they're getting to know each other but don't want 
                to seem like they're trying too hard.
            </p>

            <p>
                He showed me his Spotify playlists once. I can't remember what was on them anymore, 
                but I remember the gesture — the way he turned his phone toward me like he was 
                showing me something private.
            </p>

            <div class="memory-box">
                <p><strong>Things I learned early on:</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li>• Both his parents were engineers</li>
                    <li>• He grew up in California but came here for university</li>
                    <li>• He lived off-campus and walked 40 minutes to get to the library</li>
                    <li>• He was really, genuinely good at math and programming</li>
                    <li>• He kept detailed Excel sheets of his daily expenses</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                That last one I found out because I complained about how expensive the meal plan was. 
                He pulled up his spreadsheet without hesitation — showed me exactly how he budgeted 
                $18 per day for food by cooking simple meals at home.
            </p>

            <p>
                "It's not that hard," he said about cooking. "I knew I'd move out eventually, 
                so I asked my parents to teach me before I left."
            </p>

            <p>
                There was something about that — the way he planned ahead, the way he thought 
                about his future self — that made him feel more real than most people I'd met.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "I can burn down a kitchen. I only use the microwave."
            </div>

            <p>
                He laughed at that. Not politely — genuinely. Like the idea of me destroying 
                a kitchen was both absurd and somehow endearing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking back now, I think that's when it started. Not with butterflies or 
                grand romantic gestures, but with someone who listened when I spoke, 
                who showed up consistently, who made space feel less empty.
            </p>

            <p>
                The beginning was gentle. Uncertain. Like the first few notes of a song 
                you don't yet know you'll memorize.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 60px; font-style: italic; color: #7f8c8d;">
                And I had no idea how much that song would mean to me.
            </p>
