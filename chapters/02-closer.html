            <p>
                I started inviting him to study together at the library. 
                He never refused. Not once.
            </p>

            <p>
                I told him he didn't have to come out of politeness, that I'd understand 
                if he was busy or just didn't feel like it. His response stayed with me:
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Being polite doesn't mean I do things I don't want to."
            </div>

            <p>
                It was such a simple sentence. But it meant he <em>chose</em> to be there. 
                That every time he showed up, it was because he wanted to, not because he felt obligated.
            </p>

            <p>
                He walked 40 minutes from his apartment to meet me. And sometimes, 
                when I asked what he was doing, he'd just be on Discord or researching 
                strategies for his puzzle card game. Not even studying. Just... existing 
                in the same space as me.
            </p>

            <div class="memory-box">
                <p><strong>The card game explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    One day I asked about the game he played. He lit up immediately — 
                    spent what felt like an hour explaining the mechanics, showing me 
                    his entire deck of cards, teaching me strategies even though I barely 
                    understood what was happening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If you want to learn how to play, you can ask me," he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I never did learn. But I loved watching him talk about it.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                There was something about the way he explained things — patient, 
                thorough, never making me feel stupid for not understanding. 
                Like teaching me mattered more than showing off what he knew.
            </p>

            <p>
                He seemed nervous a lot. Especially in those first 15 minutes whenever 
                we met. I could hear his breathing, see him scrolling aimlessly on his laptop, 
                or suddenly lying face-down on the desk before sitting up again moments later.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first time I invited him to the library, he went to the bathroom four times 
                in two hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                I didn't understand it then. Now I think I do.
            </p>

            <div class="code-memory">
<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="string">studySession</span> = {
  duration: <span class="string">"2-3 hours"</span>,
  location: <span class="string">"library, study room, discussion room"</span>,
  
  hisState: {
    first15min: <span class="string">"visibly anxious"</span>,
    after15min: <span class="string">"relaxed, smiling, engaged"</span>,
    bathroomTrips: <span class="string">"frequent (nervous habit?)"</span>
  },
  
  myState: {
    feeling: <span class="string">"comfortable, warm, familiar"</span>,
    focus: <span class="string">"split between work and watching him"</span>
  }
};
            </div>

            <p>
                Before my calculus final, I asked him how he practiced for math. 
                He said he'd read theory, do practice problems, and then offered: 
                "If you want to go over some practice problems together, let me know."
            </p>

            <p>
                I said I could practice on my own. He insisted that studying with someone else 
                was more efficient. I regretted declining almost immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
                That night, I texted him. Asked if we could work through problems together. 
                We booked a discussion room — just the two of us, door closed.
            </p>

            <div class="memory-box">
                <p><strong>The math session:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I would calculate everything in my head out of habit. 
                    He kept laughing and saying "impressive" every single time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't impressive. It was just how I learned to do math. 
                    But the way he said it made me feel like maybe it was special.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like <em>I</em> was special.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                His texts were strange. Academic questions? Instant replies. 
                But casual conversation? The response time stretched longer and longer 
                as we got to know each other better.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once, after a study session, he asked if I wanted to meet again. 
                Said he'd text me the location. He never did. I had to message him first, 
                tell him where I was, and only then did he show up.
            </p>

            <p>
                It confused me. Still does, a little.
            </p>

            <p>
                But when we were together, something shifted. He'd ask me how long I planned 
                to study, tell me not to stay too late, suggest I "do something fun" instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like he cared. Not in a way that demanded anything from me, but in a way 
                that felt... gentle. Protective, almost.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "I think people who know how to cook are smart."
            </div>

            <p>
                I said this to him once, after he explained his meal prep routine again. 
                He laughed and said it really wasn't that hard.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I wasn't talking about the cooking. I was talking about the kind of person 
                who plans ahead, who takes care of themselves, who doesn't wait for someone else 
                to fix things.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was talking about him.
            </p>

            <div class="memory-box">
                <p><strong>Small observations that felt big:</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li>• When I drank water, he drank water. Every time.</li>
                    <li>• He started covering his mouth when eating, though awkwardly, like he just learned to do it.</li>
                    <li>• He mentioned he might be able to stay in Canada after graduating.</li>
                    <li>• The 👍 emoji in group chats became ❤️ in our private messages.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                I didn't know what any of it meant. Or maybe I knew and was too scared to believe it.
            </p>

            <p>
                We were getting closer. Not in dramatic leaps, but in small, quiet increments. 
                Like two orbits gradually tightening around each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                I didn't know if we'd ever collide.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I was starting to hope we would.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 60px; font-style: italic; color: #7f8c8d;">
                And that hope felt both terrifying and inevitable.
            </p>
